->Data can tell a story about relationships, and with  this information, organisations can improve almost any aspect of their operation.
->although data can be valuable, too much information is unwieldy , and the wrong data is useless.
->The right data collection method can mean the difference between useful insights and time-wasting misdirection.
->organisation have several tools at their disposal for primary data collection.
->The methods  range from traditional and simple, such as;
                              Face-to-face interview
                              to more sophisticated ways to collect and analyze  data
 ->Data collection methods:
                     interviews
                     Questionnaires and surveys
                     observations
                     Documents and records
                     Focus groups
                     oral history
 ->Qualitative VS Quantitative data collection methods
   -------------------------------------------------------
   ->quantitative - deals with something that can be counted.
                  -In general ,Questionnaires, surveys and documents and records are quantitative.
   
   ->Qualitative - considers factors other than numerical values.
                 - inteviews, focus groups, observations and oral histories are qualitative
   
   
   Qualitative data collection methods
   ------------------------------------
   ->Data analysis can take various formats.
   ->The methods you choose depends on the subject matter of  your research.
   ->Quantitative methods, such as survey, large-scale benchmarks and prioritization answer the question "how much"
   ->These method can leave the question why? unanswered. this is where qualitative data collection methods comes  into play.
   ->looks at several factors to provide a depth of understanding to raw data.
   ->involves the collection, analysis, and management of data, instract of counting  responses or recording numeric data,
   ->It aims at assess factors like the thoughts and feelings of research participants.
   ->It goes beyond recording events to create context.
   ->With this enhanced view, researchers can;
               Describe the environment . Understanding where observations take place can add meaning  to recorded numbers.
               Identify the people involved in the study. If research is limited to a particular group of people, whether 
               intentionally or as a function of demographic or other factors, 
               Describe the content of the study. sometimes, the specific activities involved in research  and how
               messages about the study were delivered and received may illuminate factors about the study.

               THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
               ----------------------------------------
               Framework - described as the abstract ,logical structure of meaning that guide the development of the study.
                         - they are based on the identification of key concepts and the relationships among those concept
                         - Derived from related concepts(conceptual) or existing theories (theoretical)
                         
               concept -abstractly describes and names an object or phenomenon, providing it  with a separate identity and meaning.
                       - an intellectual representation of some aspect of reality that is derived from observations made from phenomena.
                       -example are: anxiety, stress or pain.
               Construct - concept at a very high levels of abstraction that have general meanings.
                          - Examples:
                                     a construct associated with the concept of anxiety.
                                     emotional responses.
              Variables - signifies a more concrete level and are narrow in their definitions
                        - is more specific and   is measurable.
                        - 
             
            conceptual framework - consist of concepts that are placed within a logical and sequential design.
                                 - represents a less formal structure and  and used for studies in which existing theory is inapplicable or is 
                                    inapplicable or insufficient.
                                 - based on  specific concepts and propositions
                                 -Derived from empirical observation and intuition.
                                 -May deduce theories from a  conceptual framework.
Purpose of conceptual Frameworks
                                 - To clarify concept and purpose relationships among the concepts in a study.
                                 -To provide a concept for interpreting the  study findings.
                                 -to explain observations
                                 -To encourage theory development that is useful to practice.
                                 
                                 
      Theorical Framework
      --------------------
-The theory provides a point of focus for attacking the unknown in a specific area.
-If a relationship is found between two or more variable a theory should be formulated to explain why the relationship exists.
-Theories are purposely created and formulated, never discovered, they can be tested but never proven.
-Theory - explanation of a phenomenon or an abstract generalization that systematicaly explain the relationships among given phenomena, for purposes of explaining, 
predicting  and controlling such phenomena.
-The explanation concerns the relationship between two or more variables or phenomena.
-More formal and used for studies based on existing theories.
-Derived from  specific concepts and propositions that are induced or deduced.



Importance of theory in research
----------------------------------
-It identifies the starting point of the research problem and to
 establish the vision to which the problems is directed.
-It determines and defines the focus and goal of the research problem.

Key terms  to understand
------------------------
-Conceptualization - The process of forming basic ideas, designs, 
                   plans or strategies based on given facts, situations and examples.
-Propositions - A statement or assertion of the relationship between concepts 
               derived from theories or generalizations based on empirical data.
               
               
               Purposes of theoretical Framework
               -----------------------------------
 -To test theories
 -to make research findings meanings and generalizable
 -To predict and control situations
 -To similate research.
 
               Purpose of theories and conceptual Models
               --------------------------------------------
 -The overall purpose  is to make research findings meaningful and generalizable.
 -Help to simulate research and the extension of knowledge  by providing both direction and impetus.
 
 
 -Theoretical  framework and conceptual frameworks may be represented as models.
 -A model - is a symbolic representation that helps the researcher to express abstract concepts and relations easily, using minimal words.
          - can be represented schematically or mathematically.
 -schematic model - conveys concept and propositions through the use of boxes, arrows or other symbols.
 -Mathematical or statistical model - convey concepts and propositions through the use of letters, numbers and mathematcal symbols.
 
 
 conceptual paradigm
 ----------------------
 -A diagram that visually represents and interprets the underlying  theory, principles and concepts of a research.
 -A visual presentation of variables that interrelate  with one another as perceived by the researcher
  before an actual empirical investigation is done to prove its relationships.


 system analysis and Design - overviews
 ----------------------------------------
 -System development is systematic process which includes phases such as
                                       planning
                                       analysis
                                       Design
                                       deployment
                                       maintenance
                                       
System Analysis
--------------------
-Process of collecting and interpreting facts, identifying the problems, and decompositions of a system into
 its components.
-System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order
 to identify its objectives.
- It is a problem solving technique that improves the systems and ensures that all the 
  components of the systems work efficient to accomplish their purpose.
- Analysis specifies what the system should do.


Systems design
-----------------
-A process of planning a new business system or replacing an existing system by
 defining its components or modules to satisfy the specific requirement.
-Before planning, you need to understand the old system thorough and determine how computers can best be used
 in order to operate effeciently.
-Focus on how to accomplish the objective of the system.
-Both design and analysis focuses on 
                system
                process
                Technology
  
  
  
  
  What is a system
  -------------------
  -Derived from greek word systema
  -organized relationship between any set of components to achieve some commpon cause or objective.
  -Orderly grouping of interdependent components linked together according to a plan to achieve a specific goal.
  
  Constraints of a systems
  -----------------------
  -A systems must have three basic constraints
    -Must have some structure and behavior which is designed to achieve a predefined object.
    -interconnectivity and interdependence must exist among the systems components.
    -The objectives of the oroganization have a high priority than the objectives of its subsystems.
    
    properties of a systems
    ---------------------------
 -Organization
     -implies structure and order.
     -It is the arrangement of component that helps to achieve predetermined objectives.
 -interaction
      -Defined by the manner in which the components operate with each other.
      -I.e an organization, purchasing deparment must interact with production  department and payroll with personnel department.
 -Interdependence
      -Means how the components of a system depend on one another.
      -For proper functioning, the components are coordinated and linked together according to a specified plan.
      -The output of one subsystem is the requirement by other subsystem as input
 -Integration
       -concerned with how a system components are connected together.
       - Meaning the parts of the system work together within system even if each part perform  a unique function.
-Central objective
       -the objective of a system must be central
       -it may be real or stated
       -It is not uncommon for an organisation to state an objective and operate to achieve another.
       -the user must know the main objective of a computer application early in the analysis for a successful design and conversion.
       
       
 Elements of a systems 
 ------------------------------
 inputs
 processor
 output
 feedback
 
 Output and inputs
 ----------------------
 -The main aim of a system is to produce an output which is useful for its users.
 -Inputs are the information that enters into the  system for processing.
 -output is the outcome of processing
 
 Processor(S)
 ------------------
 -Is the element of a system that involves the actual transformation of input into output.
 -It is the operational component of a system.
 -Modifies the input either totally or partially, depending  on the output specification.
 
 
 controls
 ----------
 -Guides the system
 -It is the decision-making subsystem that controls the pattern of activies governing input, processing and output.
 -Operating system and software - control the behavior of a computer system.
 
 
 Feedback
 --------------
 -Provides the control in a dynamic system.
 -Positive feedback is routine in nature that encourages the performance of a the systems.
 -Negative feedback is informational in nature that provides the controller with information for action.
 
Environment
-----------
 -is the Supersystem within which an organisation operates
 -It is the source of eternal elements that strike on the systems
 -It determines how a system must function.
 
bounderies and interfaces
-------------------------
-A system  should be defined by its bounderires.
-bounderies - are the limits that identify its components, processes, and interrelationships when it interfaces with another system.
-Each system has bounderies that determines  its  sphere of influence and control.
-the knowledge of the bounderies of a given systems is cruial in determining the nature of its interface with other systems for successful design.

Types of systems
--------------------
a)Physical or abstract systems
----------------------------
-physical systems - are tangible enties.
                    can be touched and felt
                    can be static or dynamic in nature.
                    dynamic(can change acccording to the users needs)
                    
 -Abstract systems - non-physical entities or conceptuals
                     may be formulas representation or models of  a real systems
                     
 b)Open or closed systems
 -------------------------
 -An open systems must interact with its enviroment/
 -it receives inputs from and delivers outputs to the outside of the system.
 -ie information system must adapt to the changing enviroment condition.
 -A close system does not interact with its environment.
 -it is isolated  from enviromental influence.
 -A completely closed system is rare in reality.
 
 
 c)Adaptive and Non Adaptive system
 -------------------------------------
 -Adaptive system - response to the change in the enviroment in a way to improve from their performance and to survive.
 -Non Adaptive system - does not repond to the environment 
 
 d)Permanent or temporary systems
 ----------------------------------
 -Permanent system - persist for long time,ie business policies
 -Temporary system - made for specificied time and after that they are demolished.
  ie A DJ systems is set up for a program and it is dissembled after  the program.
  
  
  Natural and Manufactured systems
  --------------------------------------
  -Natural are created by the nature if solar, seasonal systems
  -Manufactures - man-made 
  
  Deterministic or probilistic systems
  -------------------------------------
  -Determinstic - operates in a predictable manner and the interaction between system component is known with certainty.
  -Probabilistics - show uncertain behavior.
                  - the exactly output is known .
                  
                  
  Social, human-machine, machine system 
  -------------------------------------------
  -Social system - made up of people . ie social clubs, sociaties.
  -Human-machine system - both human and machine are involved to perform a particular task. ie computer programming.
  -Machine system - where human interference is neglected. All the task is performed by the machine. ie autonomous robot.
  -
  
  Man-made information system
  --------------------------------
  -It is interconnected set of information  resource to manage data 
   for particular organization, under direct management control(DMC)
  -this system includes hardware, software, communication,
   data, and application for producing information according to the need of an organisation.
 -divided into:
              formal information system
                                      -based on the flow of information in the form of
                                       memo, instruction
              Informal information system
                                      based system  which solve the day to day work related problem.
                                      
              computer Based system 
                                      directly dependent on the computer for managing business applications.
                                      for example, automactic library system, railway reservation system.
                                      
                                      
           System Models
           -----------------
  schematic models
  --------------------
  -is a 2-D chart that shows systems elements and their linkages.
  -difference arrows are used to show information flow, material flow, and information feedback.
  
  
  flow system models
  --------------------
  -Shows the ordely flow of the materials, energy, and information that hold the system together.
  -program Evaluation and Review Technique(PERT) for example, is used to abstract a real world system in model form.
  
  
  Static System models
  ---------------------
  -They represent one pair of relationship such as activityl-time  or cost-quantity
  -the Gantt chart, for example gieves a statics  picture of an activity-time relationship.
  
      
 Dynamic System models
 -----------------------
 -For example is Business organisation
 -Approximates the type of organisation or application that anaysts deal with.
 -Show an ongoing, constantly changing status of the system 
 -Consist of :
           input that enters the systems
           The processor through which transformation takes place
           the program(s) required for processing
           the output(s) that result from processing
           
           
Categories of informations
------------------------------
-they are 3 information related to managerial level and the decision managers make:
     Strategic information
     management control information
     operational information
        
                                Strategic information            management control infarmation           operational information     
                                ---------------------           ---------------------------------         ----------------------------
-volume of information -  low consensed                         medium moderately processed               large detail reports
-type of information      unstructured                          moderately structure                      highly structure
-management level         upper                                 middle                                    MIS 
-System support           Dss                                   Lower                                     DPS



Strategic information
--------------------
- Required by topmost management for long range planning policies for next few years.
-ie trending in revenue, financial investment, and human resource and population growth.
-

managerial information
-----------------------
-required by middle management for short  and intermidiate range planning which in terms of months . for
example sales, analysis, cash flow project and annual financial statement.

operation information
--------------------------
-Required by low management for daily and short term planning, to enforce day-to-day operation activities.
-Examples Keeping employee attendance records, overdue purchase orders
-Achieved with the aid of data processing system(DPS)


System development life cycles(SDLC)
0----------------------------0

         WRITING RESEARCH REPORT
       ---------------------------------
->As a university student you may be required to write a variety of report for  
 assessment purpose.
 ->A research  report is one type that is often used in the sciences, engineering and
 psychology.
 ->Aim is to write clearly and concisely about your research topic so that the reader can 
 easily understand the purpose and results of your research.
 ->N/B you must carefully read your course information details to ensure that you comply with what 
 the lecturer/tutor  stipulates.
 ->A report is typically made up of three main devisions.
                       preliminary
                       body
                       supplimentary
->Each containing different kind of content.
->Preliminary - Title of report
                table of contents
                (Not always required)
                Abstract/synopsis
 ->Body of report- Introduction
                   Literature review
                   (sometimes included in the introduction)
                   Methodology
                   results
                   Discussion
                   Recommendations
                   (sometimes included in the conclusion)
 ->Supplementary material - References or Bibliography
                            Appendies



->title of report - concise heading indicating what the report is about.
->Table of contents(not always required) - List of sections and 
                                           headings with page number.
->Abstract/synopsis - concise summary of main findings
->Introduction - Why and what you research
->Literature Review(Sometimes included in the introduction) - Other relevant research 
                                                             in this area
->Methodology - what you did and how you did it.
->Results - What you found
->Discussion - Relevance of you results, how it fits with other research in the area.
->conclusion - summary of the findings/results
->Recommendations(sometimes included in the conclusion) - What need to be done as a result of your findings
->References or Bibliography - All references used in your  report or referred to  for background information.
->Appendices - any additional materials which will add to you report.


Step1
-----
Analyse the task
----------------
->Analyse of what is expected of you.
->this involves careful reading of the assignment task as outlined in your course information book
->questions to find usedful when analysing the task.
           what is the purpose of the report?(analysing, persuading, or report on an investigation)
->Who is the audience for the report?
->What is the word limit?(most times the word limit only includes the body of the report)
->What is the topic of the report?(the topic may be specified by the lecture or othertime you need to choice)
->What is the expected format of the report?


Step2
--------
Develop a rouch plan
--------------------
->use section heading to assist with rough plan.
->Write a thesis  statement that clarifies the overal purpose of your report.
->Jot down anything you already know about the topic in the relevent sections.


Step 3
----------
Do The research
--------------
->can be guided by step 1 and 2.
->You may need to report on other research on a particilar topic  or do some
 research of your own.
->Keep referring to your analysis and rough plan  while you are doing your research
to ensure you remain in the track.
->Give yourself plenty of time for this step, as  the research phase of yout work
will usually take the most time of any step in producing your report.
->Also, ensure you keep correct bibliographic details for all of the material you may later 
use in your report.

Step 4
------------
Draft the Body of your report
----------------------------------
->introduction - The purpose of your report
                 the thesis statement will be useful here.
                 Background information may include a brief review of the literature already
                 available on the topic so that you are able to 'place' your research in the field.
                 some brief details of your methods and an outline of  the structure of the report.
->Literature Review -> If asked to do a separate literature review, you must
                      carefully structure  your  findings.
                    ->It may be useful to do a chronological format where  you discuss 
                    from the earliest to the lasted research.
                    -Place your research approprietely in the chronology.
                    ->Alternately, you could write in a thematic ways outlining the various 
                     themes that you discovered in the research regarding the topic.
                    ->You will need  to state where your research fit.
->Methodology   ->clearly ourline what methodology you used in your research.
                -What you did and how you did it.
                ->It must be clearly written so that it would be easy for another researcher to diplicate
                your  research if they wish to.
                ->If Is usually written in a passive voice - ie the participants were asked
                to fill the questionnaire attached in appendix)
                ->Clearly reference any materials or have used  from other sources.
                -Clearly label and number any diagrams, chats and graphs.
                ->Ensure they are relevant to research  and add substance to the 
                text rather than just duplicating what you have said.
                ->You dont include the results here.
                Results - this is where you indicate what you found in your research.
                        - You give the results of your research, but do not interpret them.
               Discussion - This is where you discuss the relevence of your results and how  your findings
                           fits with other research in the area.
                           It will relate back to your literature review and your introductory thesis statement.
                           
             conclusion - This is the summary of the most significant results/findings.
                          you should not include any new material in this section.
                          sometimes you could indicate some areas where your research has limits or
                          where further research would be usedful.
            Recommendations - This includes suggestions for what  needs to be done as a result of your findings.
                            Recommendations are usually listed in order of priority.

                    how to Write  research paper
                    ----------------------------
-Describe your methods
-Justify your choice of methods
-Connecting your methods to  your research goals


->Research methodology 
           -section of any academic research paper
           -give you the opportunity to convince your reader that you research is useful and will contribute to your field
           of study.
           whether qualitative or quantitative - and  adequately describes the methods you  used.
           -Justify you chose those methods over others 
           -Explain how these methods will provide answers to your research questions.
 

part 1: Describe your methods
----------------------------------
Step1
------
Restate your research problem.
Begin your research methodology section by listing the problems or questions you intend to study.
include your hypotheses , if appicable,  or what you are setting out to prove through your research.
in your restatement, include any underlying assumption that you are making or conditions that are you're taking for granted.
these assumptions will also inform the research methods you' have chosen.
State the variables you' ll test and other conditions you're controlling or assuming are equal.


Step2
-------
-Establish your overal methodological approach 
-Your overal  approach will be either qualitative or quantitative
-You may also use a mix of both approaches
-Briefly explain why you chose your approach.
-As  a quantitative approach focus on data collection and  statistical analysis if you want to research and document measurable  social trends, or 
evaluate the impact of particular policy on varous variables.
-chose qualitative approach if you want to evaluate peoples views or understand a particular issue.
-combine both incase you are looking at measurable social trend but also interview people and get their opinions  on how that 
trend is affecting their lifes.

step 3
-------
-Define how you collect or generate data.
-tell your reader  when and where you conducted your research
-and what basic parameters  were put into place to ensure the relative objective of your result.
-for example if you conduct survey,
- you would describe the questions included in the survey, where and how the survet was conducted.(such as in person, online or over phone)
-how many survets were distributed
-how long your responded respondents had to complete the survey.
-include enough details that your study can replicate by other in your field


Step4
---------
-provide background for uncommon methods
-particularly in the social science, you may use methods that are'nt typically or that  don't seem to fit with  your research problem,.
-These method may require additional explanation.
-Qualitative research methods typically require more detailed explanation than quantitative methods
-Basic investigative procedure don't  need to be explained in detail.
-you can assume that you reader have a general understanding of common research methods that social scientist use. such as surveys or focus groups


Step five
----------
-Cite any source that contributed to your choice of methodolody.
-if you used  anyones else's work to help you craft or apply your methodology., discuss those  works and how they contributes to you
own work or how your work is build on theirs.
-mention contribution sources





part 2
-------------
 step six
 --------
 -Explain your selection criteria for data collection.
 -if you are collecting  primary data, you like set eligibility parameters
 -State those parameters clearly and let you reader know why you set those parameters and how they are important to your research.
 -Describe  study participants specifically
 -list any inclusion or exclusion criteria  you use when forming  your group of participants
 -Justify the size of your sample, if applicable.
 -Describe how this affects  your study  can be generalized to large population.
 -if you conducted a survey  of 30 percent of the student population of a university.
- you could potentially apply those results to the student body as a whole, but maybe not to students at other universities.


Step 7
-------
-Distinguish your research from any weakness in your methods.
-Every research methods has strenght and weakness.
-briefly discuss the weakness or critism of the methods  you've chosen, 
-Explain how those irrelevant or inapplicable to your particular research.
-reading other research papers is a good way to identify potential problems that commonly arise with various  methods.
-State whether you  actually encountered any these common problems during  your research.

Step 8
---------
-Describe how  you overcame obstacles.
-overcomming obstacles in your research  can be one of the most important parts of your methodology.
-Your problem -solving ability can enhance your reader's confidence in the result of your study.

Step 9
------
-Evaluate other methods you have used.
-particularly if you're using methods that are more typically used for your type of research.
-Explain why you chose not to use them.


part 3
------------
connecting your  methods  to your research  goals
----------------------------------------------------
Step 10
------------
-Describe  how you analyzed your results.
-Your analysis generally  depends on whether your approach is -qualitative, 
                                                              -quantitative
                                                              -mixture of the two.
-If you are using quantitative approach, you may be using  statistical analysis.With a qualitative approach ,
   state  what theoretical perspective or  philosophy you are using.
-Depending on  yor research question, you may be mixing quantitative and qualitative analysis - just as you could potentially use both approach.


Step 11
-------------
-Explain how  your analysis suits your research goals. 
-Ultimately , your overal methodology should be capable of producing answers to your research questions.
If it isn't well-suited , you need to either adjust  your methodolgy or reframe  your research questions.
-
Step 12
-------
-identify how your analysis answers your research questions.
-Relate  your methodology back to your original research questions and present a proposed outcome based on your analysis.
-Describe specifically what you findings will reveal about your research questions.
If in answering   your research questins, you findings have raised 
 other questions that may require further research ,state these briefly
-You also include here any limitations  to your methods, or questions that weren't answered throu   ght your research.


Step 13
--------
-Assess whether your findings can be transfered or generalized. 
-You may  be able to transfer your findings to  other context, or generalize them to a broader populations.
-Transfering can be difficult in social science research, particularly if you used a qualitative approach.
-Generalization is more typically used in quantitative research.

Research hypothesis and definning variables
---------------------------------------------
->Research hypothesis - an educated guess or hunch
                        can be supported by theories and previous research.
                      - A wise guess formulated and temporarily adopted to 
                       explain the observed facts covered by the study.
                      -Declarative statement that is tentative in nature.
                      - Must be tested explained and measured.


 types of hypothesis
 ----------------------
 ->Null hypothesis - a denial of an attribute, 
                     an existence, a difference or an effect of relationship 
                     expressed in nagative statement.
  ->Alternative hyphothesis - affirm the existence of phenomenon,
                              acceptence of attributes of relationship 
                              effect of difference.
                             -IE The is a signifincance  difference in the perception
                             of the differnce groups of respondent of respondents on the effective
                             of the program in terms of its vision.
                             
                             
                             
                             Characteristics of hyphothesis
                             -------------------------------
                    ->Testable 
                      logical
                      directly related to the research problem 
                      factually or theoretically based - states a relationship between variables
                      set limits of study - stated in a form that  can be accepted or rejected.
                      
                      
                      Sources of hyphothesis
                      ---------------------
                    -Based on -observation 
                              -enviroment
                              -on literature 
                              - imperical data -personal experience
                              
                  Creteria for evaluating research hyphothesis 
                  --------------------------------------------
-Stated in declarative form
-Be consistent with known facts, previous research and theories.
-statement should follow from the statement of the research.
-State the expected relationship between two or more variables.
-Testable 
-stated clearly and concisely
-The level of significance  must be indicated when stating the null  hypothesis.



Research variables
------------------------
-Are qualities, properties or characteristics of person, things or situation that changes or varies.

Characteristics of variables
----------------------------
-Identify the concepts to be studied
-They are measurable.
-Usually specific in focus.

Different classification of variables
--------------------------------------
-Acording to possible number of values 
 dichotomous variables - take only two values ie religion(catholic or noncholic)
 Polytomous variables - takes more than two values ie nationaliey
