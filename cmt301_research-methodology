->Data can tell a story about relationships, and with  this information, organisations can improve almost any aspect of their operation.
->although data can be valuable, too much information is unwieldy , and the wrong data is useless.
->The right data collection method can mean the difference between useful insights and time-wasting misdirection.
->organisation have several tools at their disposal for primary data collection.
->The methods  range from traditional and simple, such as;
                              Face-to-face interview
                              to more sophisticated ways to collect and analyze  data
 ->Data collection methods:
                     interviews
                     Questionnaires and surveys
                     observations
                     Documents and records
                     Focus groups
                     oral history
 ->Qualitative VS Quantitative data collection methods
   -------------------------------------------------------
   ->quantitative - deals with something that can be counted.
                  -In general ,Questionnaires, surveys and documents and records are quantitative.
   
   ->Qualitative - considers factors other than numerical values.
                 - inteviews, focus groups, observations and oral histories are qualitative
   
   
   Qualitative data collection methods
   ------------------------------------
   ->Data analysis can take various formats.
   ->The methods you choose depends on the subject matter of  your research.
   ->Quantitative methods, such as survey, large-scale benchmarks and prioritization answer the question "how much"
   ->These method can leave the question why? unanswered. this is where qualitative data collection methods comes  into play.
   ->looks at several factors to provide a depth of understanding to raw data.
   ->involves the collection, analysis, and management of data, instract of counting  responses or recording numeric data,
   ->It aims at assess factors like the thoughts and feelings of research participants.
   ->It goes beyond recording events to create context.
   ->With this enhanced view, researchers can;
               Describe the environment . Understanding where observations take place can add meaning  to recorded numbers.
               Identify the people involved in the study. If research is limited to a particular group of people, whether intentionally or as a function of demographic or other factors, 
               Describe the content of the study. sometimes, the specific activities involved in research  and how messages about the study were delivered and received may illuminate factors about the study.
               
               
               
               THEORETICAL AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
               ----------------------------------------
               Framework - described as the abstract ,logical structure of meaning that guide the development of the study.
                         - they are based on the identification of key concepts and the relationships among those concept
                         - Derived from related concepts(conceptual) or existing theories (theoretical)
                         
               concept -abstractly describes and names an object or phenomenon, providing it  with a separate identity and meaning.
                       - an intellectual representation of some aspect of reality that is derived from observations made from phenomena.
                       -example are: anxiety, stress or pain.
               Construct - concept at a very high levels of abstraction that have general meanings.
                          - Examples:
                                     a construct associated with the concept of anxiety.
                                     emotional respinses.
              Variables - signifies a more concrete level and are narrow in their definitions
                          is more specific and   is measurable.
             
            conceptual framework - consist od cencepts that are placed within a logical and sequential design.
                                 - represents a less formal structure and  and used for studies in which existing theory is inapplicable or iss
