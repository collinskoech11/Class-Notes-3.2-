INTRODUCTION
-------------
->programming language that can be included on out  pages to make them 
more interactive 
->used to modify the content  of forms, change images, open new windows and write dynamic page content.
->used with css to make DHTML(Dynamic hperText makeUp language)
->this allows you to make parts of your web paes ppear or disappear or move around on the page.
->It only execte on the pages  that are on your browser  window at any set time.
->When the user stop viewing that page  , any script that were runnning on it are  immediately stopped.
->the only exceptions are cookies or various client side storage API, which can be used by many pages to store 
and pass information  between them, even after the pages have been closed.

->Java is a cient side, interpreted, object oriented, high level scripting language.




Lesson six 
-----------
->GRAPICS USING HTML CANVAS
-----------------------------
->canvas element is part of html five
->allows for dynamic, scripable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.
->consist of a drawable region defined in HTML code height and  width attributes.
->javascript code may access the area though  a full set of drawing functions similar to those
of other common @D APIs , thus allowing dynamically generated    graphics.
->some uses of canvas are building graphics, animations, games and image composition.


Understanding the HTML five DOctype
------------------------------------
->A document type declaration, or DOCTYPE for short is an instruction to the web browser about 
the version of markup language in which a web page is written.
->According the HTML specification  of standard , every  HTML document require a valid document type  declaraion to 
ensure  that your web pages are displayed the way they aee intended to be displayed.
->


Canvas Elements Size versus Drawing surface size
---------------------------------------------------
->canvas have two sizes:
                  1)the size of the element(canvas) itself 
                  2)the sixe of the element's drawing surface.
->Setting the element's width and height attributes sets both of the these sizes;
->CSS attribute affect only the element's size and not the drawing surface.
->By difault, both the canvas element's size and the size of its drawing surface is 3000 screen
pixel wide and one  hundred and fifty screen pixels hight.
->When a canvas element's size does not match  the size of its drawing surface, the borwser scales the drawing surface to fit the element (which may result in surprising and unwanted effects.




Understanding the Canvas coordinates
---------------------------------------
->The canvas is a two-dimensional rectangular area.
->the coordinate of the top-left corner of the canvas are(0,0) which is known as the origin,
->The coordinate of the  bottom-right corner are(canvas width, canvas height)


Using Javascript to Access the canvas attributes
----------------------------------------------------
display and reset the canvas drawing dimension
------------------------------------------------
 <!DOCTYPE HTML>
 <html>
 <head>
 <style>
 #mycanvas{border:3px solid red;}
 </style>
 </head>
 <body>
 <canvas id ="mycanvas" width="100" height="100"></canvas>
 <script>
 var canvas =document.getElementById("mycanvas");
 //displaying the width and the height
 alert(canvas.width);
 alert(canvas.height);
 //increasing the width and height
 canvas.width=200;
 canvas.height=300;
