    software Process(SP)
    -------------------------
    -software process models
    -process activities
    -plan-driven vs agile process 
    -Requirement Engineering
    -Design activities
    -Software Testing
    -Software Evolution
    
 -A structure set of activities required to develop a software system.
 -Different software process
                    Specification - defines what system should do.
                    Design and implementation - define the organization of the
                                               system and implementing the system
                    validation - checks that it does what the customer wants.
                  EVolution - changing  the system in response to changing  customer needs.
 -An abstract representation of a process.
 -It presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.
                       



software process description
---------------------------------
-Talks about the activities such as 
                 specifying a data  model,
                 designing a user interface
                 ordering of activities.
-Also include:
            Products, which are the outcomes of a process activity
            Roles, which reflect the responsibilities of the people in the process.
            Pre-and post-condition -Which are statement that are true before and after a process
            activity has been enacted or product produced.
            
            
            
            
        Plan-driven and agile process
        ---------------------------------
 -Processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and
 progress is measure against this plan.
 -In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier  to change 
 the process to reflect changing customer requirement.
 -In practical, most practical processes
  include element of both plan-driven and agile approach.
 -There are no right or wrong software processes.
 


Software process models
--------------------------
-The waterfall model
 plan-driven model. Separate and distint phases of specification and development.
-Incremental developmentand
 specification, development validation are interleaved.
 may be plan-driven or agile.
-Reuse-oriented software engineering
 The system is assembled from existing component.
 may be plan driven or agile
 
 
 

Agile Methods and software maintenance
----------------------------------------
-Most organisation spend more on maintaining existing 
software than do on new software development.
-So if agile methods are to be successful, they have to
support maintence as well as organisation development.
-systems developed using  an agile approach mainatenance,
given the emphasis in the development process of minimizing formal documentions
-Can agile methods be used effectively for evolving a system in 
response to customer change request


Techical, human, organisation issues
--------------------------------------------
-Are the cultural or organisational issuesthat may affect the system development
-Traditional engineering  organisation 


Extreme programming(XP)
---------------------
-Perhaps the best-known and most used agile method.
-takes an extreme approach to iterative development.
-principle or practice
               -incremental planning
               -pair programming
               -collective ownerdship
               -continuous integration
               -sustainable base.
               
Testing in XP
-------------------
-Central to XP and XP hasdeveloped an approach.
