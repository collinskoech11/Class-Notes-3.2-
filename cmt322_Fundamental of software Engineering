    software Process(SP)
    -------------------------
    -software process models
    -process activities
    -plan-driven vs agile process 
    -Requirement Engineering
    -Design activities
    -Software Testing
    -Software Evolution
    
 -A structure set of activities required to develop a software system.
 -Different software process
                    Specification - defines what system should do.
                    Design and implementation - define the organization of the
                                               system and implementing the system
                    validation - checks that it does what the customer wants.
                  EVolution - changing  the system in response to changing  customer needs.
 -An abstract representation of a process.
 -It presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.
                       



software process description
---------------------------------
-Talks about the activities such as 
                 specifying a data  model,
                 designing a user interface
                 ordering of activities.
-Also include:
            Products, which are the outcomes of a process activity
            Roles, which reflect the responsibilities of the people in the process.
            Pre-and post-condition -Which are statement that are true before and after a process
            activity has been enacted or product produced.
            
            
            
            
        Plan-driven and agile process
        ---------------------------------
 -Processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and process 
  in
